Suggested Order of Completion

* `hello_test.rb`
* `character_count_test.rb`
* `escape_characters_test.rb`
* `mad_lib_test.rb`
* `simple_math_test.rb`
* `retirement_test.rb`

Please note I modified the last test for Mad Libs as it made no sense to me why the second test gave the same expected result as the first test. Maybe I just didn't understand what mad libs is...
